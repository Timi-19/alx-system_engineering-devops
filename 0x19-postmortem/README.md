Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

Issue Summary:
Duration: May 17, 2023, 08:00 AM UTC - May 17, 2023, 11:00 AM UTC
Impact: Slow response times and intermittent service downtime affecting the user authentication service.
User Experience: Users experienced delays in logging in and encountered occasional failures, leading to frustration and inconvenience.
Percentage of Affected Users: Approximately 30% of users were impacted.

Timeline:
- 08:00 AM UTC: The issue was detected through monitoring alerts, indicating a spike in response time for the user authentication service.
- 08:10 AM UTC: The operations team was alerted and started investigating the problem.
- 08:20 AM UTC: Initial assumption focused on a potential database connectivity issue, leading to investigations into the database server and network connections.
- 08:40 AM UTC: The investigations into the database and network connections did not reveal any abnormalities. However, high CPU utilization was noticed on one of the application servers, leading to a diversion of focus.
- 09:00 AM UTC: Debugging efforts were primarily focused on the misbehaving application server, attempting to identify any software or configuration issues.
- 09:30 AM UTC: The operations team escalated the incident to the development team, seeking their expertise in troubleshooting the application server.
- 09:45 AM UTC: The development team conducted further analysis and determined that the issue was not isolated to the application server but was more widespread.
- 10:00 AM UTC: Attention shifted back to the database layer, specifically investigating the database query performance and indexing.
- 10:30 AM UTC: A problematic database query causing high load and impacting response times was identified.
- 11:00 AM UTC: The issue was resolved by optimizing the database query, significantly reducing the response time and restoring normal service functionality.

Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: The slow response times and intermittent downtime were caused by a poorly optimized database query, leading to high load on the database server.
Resolution: The problematic database query was optimized by introducing appropriate indexing and modifying the query execution plan. This optimization significantly improved the query's performance and alleviated the load on the database server.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
1. Improve query optimization: Review existing database queries for performance bottlenecks and optimize them to ensure efficient execution.
2. Implement database monitoring: Introduce monitoring tools to track query performance, database server metrics, and identify potential issues promptly.
3. Load testing: Conduct regular load testing to simulate peak traffic scenarios and identify any performance limitations beforehand.
4. Incident response training: Conduct training sessions for both the operations and development teams to improve incident detection, investigation, and resolution processes.
5. Implement automated alerts: Set up additional monitoring alerts to proactively detect and notify teams of abnormal response times or database performance issues.

Tasks to Address the Issue:
1. Patch the system with the latest updates to ensure all known performance-related issues are resolved.
2. Implement query optimization techniques for frequently executed queries.
3. Configure automated database performance monitoring tools to identify potential bottlenecks.
4. Schedule regular load testing sessions to identify and resolve performance limitations.
5. Conduct incident response training to improve incident handling efficiency and communication between teams.

In conclusion, the web stack outage incident was caused by a poorly optimized database query, resulting in slow response times and intermittent service downtime. Through systematic investigation and collaboration between the operations and development teams, the root cause was identified and promptly resolved. To prevent similar incidents in the future, measures such as query optimization, monitoring, load testing, and incident response training will be implemented to ensure a more robust and resilient system.
